## Mini Install Guide for GFX906

### 🐳 Using Pre-built Docker Image (Recommended)

If you have Docker and the AMD ROCm drivers/kernel modules installed on your host system, you can totally bypass the complex manual source-build installation by using our pre-built Docker image.

```bash
# Pull the latest image (or specify a tag instead of latest, e.g. v0.19.1rc0.x)
docker pull aiinfos/vllm-gfx906-mobydick:latest

# Run the container interactively (Make sure to pass ROCm devices into the container and have your models in host /home/ as we map /home:/home; feel free to edit the command below to a safer one, without priviledged and others)
sudo docker run -it --name vllm-gfx906-mobydick -v /home:/home --network host --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri \
  --group-add video --group-add $(getent group render | cut -d: -f3) \
  --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --volume /sys:/sys:ro --pid=host --privileged \
  --ipc=host aiinfos/vllm-gfx906-mobydick:latest
```

Once inside the container, you are all set! You can immediately start serving models (see the Quickstart example below).

### ⚠️ Known issues on gfx906 (MI50 / Radeon VII) with ROCm 7.2.x

If you are running on gfx906 hardware with the mobydick image built against
`mixa3607/pytorch-gfx906:vX.Y.Z-rocm-7.2.1` (the current `latest` tag), there
is a known reproducible SIGSEGV inside `libamdhip64.so.7.2.70201` that can
crash the `EngineCore` subprocess during start-up, and a rarer but more
dangerous kernel-state deadlock that can take the entire host down. Both
faults are inside the AMD HIP runtime, not in vLLM, and they are tracked in
[the upstream issue tracker](https://github.com/ai-infos/vllm-gfx906-mobydick/issues).

#### What we do for you out of the box

This fork applies the following workarounds automatically when `on_gfx906()`
is detected at import time:

- `enforce_eager=True` is forced for every model (`VLLM_GFX906_FORCE_EAGER=1`
  by default). This avoids the CUDAGraph capture path that has been observed
  to trigger the SIGSEGV.
- `VLLM_GFX906_SAFE_MODE=auto` (the default) applies a consolidated set of
  workarounds: NCCL watchdog off, NCCL P2P/GDR/IB off, AITER off,
  `VLLM_WORKER_MULTIPROC_METHOD=spawn`, `HIP_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1`,
  `FLASH_ATTENTION_TRITON_AMD_ENABLE=TRUE`.
- The EngineCore child process installs a `faulthandler` dump
  (path controllable via `VLLM_ENGINECORE_FAULT_LOG`) so a native SIGSEGV
  produces a Python stack trace on disk before the process dies.
- `wait_for_engine_startup` decodes negative child exit codes as their
  `signal.Signals` name and surfaces "EngineCore terminated by SIGSEGV"
  instead of a generic "Engine core initialization failed." You get the
  diagnostic in seconds, not after the 900 s timeout fires.

If you want to turn any of these off (e.g. you know your specific gfx906
build of `libamdhip64.so` is patched), set the corresponding env var to `0`:

```bash
export VLLM_GFX906_SAFE_MODE=0       # disable the full safe-mode set
export VLLM_GFX906_FORCE_EAGER=0     # do not force enforce_eager on gfx906
```

#### Workarounds if the auto-applied set is not enough

If you still hit the SIGSEGV after the safe-mode set is on, the next things
to try in order:

1. `HIP_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` (already on by default with safe mode).
2. `--enforce-eager` (already on by default on gfx906).
3. Pin `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO` and inspect `dmesg` for the exact offset inside
   `libamdhip64.so`; if it has shifted, file an issue with the new offset.
4. Fall back to a mobydick image built on ROCm 6.3.x:
   ```bash
   # The older v0.20.1rc0.x tag was built against ROCm 6.3.3 (per
   # build_and_push_docker.sh) and is not affected by the 7.2.x SIGSEGV.
   docker pull aiinfos/vllm-gfx906-mobydick:v0.20.1rc0.x-rocm7.2.1-pytorch2.11.0
   ```
5. File an issue at
   <https://github.com/ai-infos/vllm-gfx906-mobydick/issues> with
   `dmesg | grep -E 'traps.*EngineCor|libamdhip64'` output and the first
   200 lines of the vLLM log after `EngineCore pid=`.

The host-deadlock symptom (ssh stops responding, GPU[0] util pinned at 100 %
even though our process was on GPU[2]) cannot be fixed in vLLM; it is an
amdgpu-driver bug and must be reported to AMD with the `dmesg` output from
the moment the host became unresponsive.

### 🛠️ Manual Build from Source

If you prefer to build and install from source on your bare metal instead, follow the steps below:

### ROCm 6.3.4 & amdgpu drivers

```code
# Get the script that adds the AMD repo for 24.04 (noble)
wget https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu-install/6.3.4/ubuntu/noble/amdgpu-install_6.3.60304-1_all.deb
sudo apt install ./amdgpu-install_6.3.60304-1_all.deb

# Install ROCm  6.3.4 including hip, rocblas, amdgpu-dkms etc (assuming the machine has already the advised compatible kernel 6.11)
sudo amdgpu-install --usecase=rocm --rocmrelease=6.3.4    

sudo usermod -aG render,video $USER

# Verify ROCm installation
rocm-smi --showproductname --showdriverversion
rocminfo


# Add iommu=pt if you later grow beyond two GPUs
# ROCm’s NCCL-/RCCL-based frameworks can hang on multi-GPU rigs unless the IOMMU is put in pass-through mode
# see https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/docs-6.3.3/reference/install-faq.html#multi-gpu

sudo sed -i 's/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="iommu=pt /' /etc/default/grub
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
cat /proc/cmdline  # >>> to check: must return: "BOOT_IMAGE=... iommu=pt"

```

### vllm-gfx906-mobydick fork with its dependencies (python, torch, triton, flash-attn, etc)

cd triton-gfx906 
pip install -r python/requirements.txt
TRITON_CODEGEN_BACKENDS="amd" pip wheel --no-build-isolation -w dist . 2>&1 | tee build.log
pip install ./dist/triton-*.whl  


# FLASH-ATTENTION-GFX906 (triton backend)

git clone https://github.com/ai-infos/flash-attention-gfx906.git
cd flash-attention-gfx906
FLASH_ATTENTION_TRITON_AMD_ENABLE="TRUE" python setup.py install

# VLLM-GFX906-MOBYDICK main

git clone https://github.com/ai-infos/vllm-gfx906-mobydick.git
cd vllm-gfx906-mobydick
pip install 'amdsmi>=6.3,<6.4'

pip install ./dist/vllm-*.whl

# TRANSFORMERS (v5.7.0 or any other version <6 supporting your model)
pip install transformers==5.7.0
```

### Quickstart example (with Qwen3.5-0.8B)

```code
FLASH_ATTENTION_TRITON_AMD_ENABLE=TRUE VLLM_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B \
  --dtype float16 \
  --kv-cache-dtype float16 \
  2>&1 | tee log.txt
```

NB: --dtype float16 is recommended to add for this gfx906 fork. If not set, vllm will take the dtype from config.json model which might be bfloat16, not natively supported on gfx906 (with potential fallback to float32, leading to slower inference)
